1. Confirm Memory Constraints
Upgrade Memory: If your Railway plan has limited memory, upgrading to a plan with more resources can prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
Local Testing: Simulate Railway’s memory limits locally to confirm the issue is indeed memory-related.
2. Optimize Model Loading
Load Once: Ensure the CLIP model is loaded only once during the app’s startup instead of reloading it for every request. This avoids repeated memory spikes.
Lazy Loading: If the model isn’t needed immediately, consider lazy loading it on the first request.
Quantization: Explore using a quantized or smaller version of the CLIP model to reduce the memory footprint.
3. Review Application Code
Caching: Implement caching for the model weights so that subsequent requests do not trigger a full model reload.
Profiling: Use memory profiling tools to pinpoint any leaks or inefficient memory usage during the model loading process.
4. Container Adjustments
Resource Limits: Check your Dockerfile and container runtime settings to ensure they’re not imposing strict memory limits that might be too low for your application’s needs.
Final Thoughts
While upgrading your Railway plan may provide a quick fix by supplying more memory, combining that with code and model optimizations will offer a more robust solution. This dual approach should help stabilize your deployment and avoid repeated “Killed” errors.
